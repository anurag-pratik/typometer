Outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips, supervise study halls, help with the organization of school functions, and serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities. In some education systems, teachers may have responsibility for student discipline.","Business casual is an ambiguously defined dress code that has been adopted by many professional and white-collar workplaces in Western countries.

The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization.","Medical transcription, also known as MT, is an allied health profession dealing with the process of transcribing voice-recorded medical reports that are dictated by physicians, nurses and other healthcare practitioners. Medical reports can be voice files, notes taken during a lecture, or other spoken material. These are dictated over the phone or uploaded digitally via the Internet or through smart phone apps.","A late 20th century trend in typing, primarily used with devices with small keyboards (such as PDAs and Smartphones), is thumbing or thumb typing. This can be accomplished using one or both thumbs. Similar to desktop keyboards and input devices, if a user overuses keys which need hard presses and/or have small and unergonomic layouts, it could cause thumb tendonitis or other repetitive strain injury.","Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are people who invent, design, analyze, build, and test machines, systems, structures and materials to fulfill objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.","Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. More recently, the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated 'language localization'. Ideally, the translator must know both languages, as well as the subject that is to be translated.","Proofreader applicants are tested primarily on their spelling, speed, and skill in finding errors in the sample text. Toward that end, they may be given a list of ten or twenty classically difficult words and a proofreading test, both tightly timed. The proofreading test will often have a maximum number of errors per quantity of text and a minimum amount of time to find them. The goal of this approach is to identify those with the best skill set."]),f=(a(32),a(12)),m=a.n(f);var b=function(e){if(0!==e.characters&&0!==e.secs){var t=e.characters/5,a=e.secs/60,n=t/a;return Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"stats",children:[Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"speed",children:[Object(s.jsx)(l.a,{})," ",Math.floor(n)," words/min"]}),Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"time",children:[Object(s.jsx)(m.a,{})," ",60*a," seconds"]})]})}return null};var g=function(){var e=r.a.useState(B()),t=Object(u.a)(e,2),a=t[0],n=t[1],i=r.a.useState([]),o=Object(u.a)(i,2),c=o[0],l=o[1],d=r.a.useState(0),f=Object(u.a)(d,2),m=f[0],g=f[1],y=r.a.useState(0),j=Object(u.a)(y,2),v=j[0],x=j[1],w=r.a.useState(!1),O=Object(u.a)(w,2),k=O[0],T=O[1],N=r.a.useState(!1),I=Object(u.a)(N,2),S=I[0],M=I[1],A=r.a.useRef(null);function B(){return p[Math.floor(Math.random()*p.length)]}return Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"GameBox",children:[Object(s.jsx)("div",{className:"textDisplay",children:Object(s.jsx)(h,{displayText:a,userInput:c})}),Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"InputTextDiv",children:[Object(s.jsx)("textarea",{placeholder:"Type the above paragraph here...",autoFocus:"true",className:"InputTextBox",spellCheck:"false",onChange:function(e){var t=e.target.value;l(t),function(e){e===a&&(clearInterval(A.current),M(!0))}(t),function(e){var t=a.replace(" ","");g((function(){return e.replace(" ","").split("").filter((function(e,a){return e===t[a]})).length}))}(t),k||(T(!0),A.current=setInterval((function(){x((function(e){return e+1}))}),1e3))},value:c,name:"inputText",readOnly:S}),Object(s.jsx)("br",{}),Object(s.jsx)(b,{secs:v,characters:m}),Object(s.jsx)("button",{onClick:function(){n(B()),l([]),g(0),x(0),T(!1),M(!1)},type:"button",class:"btn btn-outline-light restartBtn",children:"Restart"})]})]})};a(33);var y=function(){return Object(s.jsx)("div",{className:"Footer",children:Object(s.jsx)("h1",{className:"footerText",children:"Made by Anurag Pratik"})})},j=a(13),v=a.n(j);var x=function(){return Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[Object(s.jsx)(d,{}),Object(s.jsx)(g,{}),Object(s.jsx)("div",{className:"githIcon",children:Object(s.jsx)(v.a,{fontSize:"large",onClick:function(e){return window.open("https://github.com/anurag-pratik","_blank")}})}),Object(s.jsx)(y,{})]})};o.a.render(Object(s.jsx)(x,{}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[35,1,2]]]);
